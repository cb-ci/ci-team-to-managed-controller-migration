# CloudBees Team Controller to Managed Controller-Migration

# Objective

This repo is about the automation steps that are required to migrate CloudBees Team Controller (**TC**) to Managed Controllers (**MC**).
The scripts is just done for K8s Platforms, CI traditional has not been done yet. 

Read about the required steps and background here:

To automate the migration from TC to MC, the following phases are required (taken from he documentation links above) 

* CREATE MC: create a destination Managed Controller
* ON MC: create target folder (where to migrate the Teams/teams root folder to )
* COPY JOBS FROM TC TO MC 
* MIGRATE CREDENTIALS
* RELOAD MC configuration from disk


# How to start

* Create a TC that you want to migrate to MC
  * Optional: For testing purposes, create some jobs on the TC (or use existing ones)
* copy `envvars.sh.template`  to `envvars.sh`
  * ``` cp envvars.sh.template envvars.sh```
  * Adjust your variables in your `envvars.sh` file
* Execute the migration script, see below
* See the `gen` dir and logs


## EFS: Migrate from TC to MC in a new namespace, using a rescue POD 
see `./migrateTC2MC-separateNamespaceByEFS.sh`

Params:
* 1: name of existing Team Controller
* 2: name of target Managed Controller
* 3: name of Team Controller namespace
* 4: name of Managed Controller namespace

Example
```
./migrateTC2MC-separateNamespaceByEFS.sh  myteam-tc myteam-mc cloudbees-core cloudbees-controllers
``` 

## EBS: Migrate from TC to MC in a new namespace, using a rescue POD and EBS Snapshot

see `./migrateTC2MC-separateNamespaceByEBSSnapshot.sh`

Params:
* 1: name of existing Team Controller
* 2: name of target Managed Controller
* 3: name of Team Controller namespace
* 4: name of Managed Controller namespace

Example
```
./migrateTC2MC-separateNamespaceByEBSSnapshot.sh  myteam-tc myteam-mc cloudbees-core cloudbees-controllers
```


# Benchmark for rescue Pod approach

How to create huge amount of job data:
```
cd $JENKINS_HOME/jobs
for i in {2501..25000};do cp -Rf testjob testjob-$i ;done
```
How to identify the number of overall job files
`find $JENKINS_HOME/jobs -type f | wc -l`

Tested with EFS rescue pod:

* For testing purpose 2500 test jobs have been created on a Team Controller, see [templates/testjob.yaml](templates/testjob.yaml)
* 2500 simple Pipeline jobs with 1 entry in the build history result in ~ 30.000 files  overall
* The job dir size is ~250 MB

Time consumed for a copy using a rescue EFS PVC/POD
```
real	12m56.919s
user	0m0.560s
sys  	0m0.226s
```

Tested with EFS AWS data sync that seems to be the fastest approach:

* 20491 jobs have been synced using AWS data sync EFS source-pvc-subdir -> EFS destination-pvc-subdir
* ~2 GB of job data
* 245898 jobs files overall have been synced
* Time consumed (including verification): 11 minutes, 21 seconds

# Conclusion: 
* AWS data sync can transfer 8 times more job data in around about the same time compared to the rescue pod approach
* In other words: Data sync is much faster! 
* AWS documentation says it is up tp 10 times faster compared to any other approach  
* TODO: add link for AWS doc

# Next Steps

* Verify if S3 backup /restore is faster 

# Extra stuff,not related to the migration script

## Migrate PVC to another namespace
